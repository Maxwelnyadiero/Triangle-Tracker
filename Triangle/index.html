  <h1><strong>Triangle Tracker</strong></h1>
  <p> It is my pleasure to continue dealing with sort of mathematics even though i thought that that i had no need to meet anyhnting like trianngle,
    it had recalled to me about the types of triangles which by i did interact with in primary and secondary life</p>
  <p> What an amazing thing is it to me now!<span>I will never regret blaming myself of what to do and what not to do,in that in life things are recurrent from one place to the other</span></p>

  <div class =("firt-triangle")
<p>The most important thing with the first triangle is that it is descent by just aminor look,in that all the sides are equal hence looks that smart,it do contain the following</P>
  <ol>
    <li>Ruler for measument</li>
    <li>Pair of compasses</li>
    <li>Rubber</li>
    <li>pencils</li>
    <div id = ("second-triangle")
